					<em><strong>-Mark Hanna Chief Marketing Officer at Richline Group, Inc.</strong></em></p>

				<p>It was an absolute pleasure to work with Michael on the production of our new ear piercing training video
					for Inverness. He delivered our final video on time and on budget and handled some unexpected changes
					seamlessly. Michael was responsible for every aspect of our shoot and excelled as our producer, director,
					editor and graphic designer. He is extremely professional, knowledgeable, and has incredible attention to
					detail. Even though we had to conduct all of our pre-production work long distance (Attleboro to
					Albuquerque), Michael coordinated all the details of our shoot expertly. He is very skilled behind the
					camera and was able to keep us on schedule while still making time to capture alternative shots. Michael
					has excellent post production skills, and the final edit exceeded our expectations. I strongly recommend
					him for any project you might be considering.
