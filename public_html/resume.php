				<h2>Recommendations</h2>

				<p>Michael has elevated our firm's brands and products to a proud level due to his ingenuity, experience and innovation with photographic and video processes… and results. He has, additionally, mentored our team to broaden our corporate capabilities. I consider him an invaluable resource for our future growth in a demanding content world.</p>
		<em>-Mark Hanna Chief Marketing Officer at Richline Group, Inc.</em>

				<p>It was an absolute pleasure to work with Michael on the production of our new ear piercing training video for Inverness. He delivered our final video on time and on budget and handled some unexpected changes seamlessly. Michael was responsible for every aspect of our shoot and excelled as our producer, director, editor and graphic designer. He is extremely professional, knowledgeable, and has incredible attention to detail. Even though we had to conduct all of our pre-production work long distance (Attleboro to Albuquerque), Michael coordinated all the details of our shoot expertly. He is very skilled behind the camera and was able to keep us on schedule while still making time to capture alternative shots. Michael has excellent post production skills, and the final edit exceeded our expectations. I strongly recommend him for any project you might be considering.</p>
