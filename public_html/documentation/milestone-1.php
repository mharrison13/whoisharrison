	<h2><em>Use Case</em>em></h2>
		<p>Last week, Bob L. Business-Owner was speaking a friend over his lack of business. His friend took a look at his website and realised that Bob's current website failed to showcase his product. On top of that, there was no way for his customers to find him or contact him. Bob's friend, having a background in marketing, suggested that rather that Bob trying to save money by doing his own website, he hire a professional to build a custom site that reflects the high quality product that Bob sells.</p>
		<p>Bob swears by his Mac and iPhone and believe that with these to components, he can build his own website. He just realized that an effective web presence is harder than he originally though.</p>
