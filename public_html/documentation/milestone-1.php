		<h2>Persona</h2>

		<p><strong>Name:</strong> Bob L. Business-Owner
		<p><strong>Age:</strong> 50</p>
		<p><strong>Profession: </strong> Employer</p>
		<p><Strong>Technology: </Strong> At work, Mac Pro 13inch. When at home Mac user with a cinema display. Also uses iPhone7.</p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behavior: </strong>Mr Business-Owner, owner of local business is looking for a web developer / DBA for their local business, whatever that may be. Last week, Bob L. Business-Owner was speaking to a friend over his lack of business. His friend looked at his website and realised that Bob's current website failed to showcase his product. On top of that, there was no way for his customers to find him or contact him. Bob's friend, having a background in marketing, suggested that rather that Bob trying to save money by doing his own website, he hire a professional to build a custom site that reflects the high quality product that Bob sells.</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong> Bob needs to hire a talented, hardworking and knowledgeable employee to help advance his business and build his web presence above that of his competition.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals: </strong>Bob really needs a web site that solves the problem of his potential customers finding and purchasing from him. He built his own website on wix and now realizes that he is losing business to his competitors because his website looks unprofessional.</p><br>

		<h2>Use Case</h2>
		<p>Feeling pressure to complete his website, Bob L. Business-Owner has taken the time to research local web developers in the area. Bob was given my information from a friend who previously hired me for a freelance job months ago and was pleased with the quality and turn-around time. Bob's research along with the recommendations from his friend, has narrowed his search down to three potential candidates including myself.</p>
		<p>It is currently 11:30AM on Monday and Bob has decided to look over my website during his lunch hour with the intent of reaching out to a potential developer. He has given himself a tight deadline to review the top candidates websites and mine if first up.</p><br>
