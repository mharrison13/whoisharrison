this is my all new portfolio site

# Milestone1 
# feedback
Purpose, audience, goals and persona are spot on. It seems that use case is just an extension of your persona. You are also missing a couple of things in the html. 
 
## Clarifications/ corrections

Your  use case missed the mark. You did not outline how someone would interact with your site. You gave no picture of how your site would look or behave.

The HTML is also incomplete you have no <html> tags. The <html="en"> tag is missing so is the <meta charset="utf-8">. 

## Update 

great job on the revisions. All the previous concerns have been addressed and it is very easy to see how someone would interact with your site. Also The HTML is correct great job
